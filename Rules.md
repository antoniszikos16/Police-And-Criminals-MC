    - You are not allowed to claim-lock others, claim over their builds, or claim within a radius of their claims without permission (claim owners are granted around 240 blocks or 15 chunks leeway).

    - Claimed land that has player activities will not be removed unless you have proof of approval from the claim owner.

    - Random/empty claims are subject for removal. Reach out to a staff member or open a support ticket in the Discord for assistance.

    - Always try to resolve claim conflicts with the other player first. If an agreement can't be made, open a support ticket.

        - it is unclaimed and staff cannot find who built it.

        - the player(s) who built it/reside in it have not been online for ONE year.

        - **Note:** in a city with multiple players, if the original owner has not been online for ONE year, another member may file to claim ownership as long as they have the approval of all other members of that city. Please open a support ticket for assistance.

    - Auto-Farming is allowed as long as:

        - it doesn't abuse any bugs or glitches.

    - Do not go out of bounds.

    - Any loopholes that are attempted to bypass or gain a significant advantage will result in immediate disqualification and punishment.

    - Any actions in an attempt to stall or delay an event or tournament is prohibited and will result in a punishment.

- **Alt Accounts**

    - You are only allowed **ONE** alt on the server. This is to prevent players from gaining too much of an advantage on others.

- **Staff Cooperation**

    - In instances where a deal/trade has gone wrong, staff may need to intervene and recoup items/money from either party involved. Depending on the case, staff might need to forcibly remove items/money or they may ask a player to work with them on returning said items/money.

    - If you find yourself involved in such a case and a staff member reaches out to you, please cooperate with them. Refusing to do so may result in a punishment.

    - Do not intentionally obstruct a staff member or provide false information in such a case.

    - If you feel a decision made by staff is unjust, please open a support or appeal ticket in the Discord.

- **No Loan Sharking**

    - Loan sharking is the practice of loaning out money with the expectation that the loan will be paid back with interest within a specified amount of time. The player giving the loan sets their own terms for how much is loaned, what the interest will be, and how long the other player has to pay back the loan.

    - We do not allow this practice on our server as it often opens people up to being scammed, which creates more work for the staff and breeds a toxic community.

- **No Begging**

    - Begging staff or other players for game items, Pokémon, game currency, or other is prohibited.
