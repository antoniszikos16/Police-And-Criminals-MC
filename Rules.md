    - Please do not private message staff on Discord when you need assistance. Open a support ticket in the Pok√©Wild Discord or use the Support Chat channel.

    - Private messaging a staff member about a ticket you have opened will not get your ticket resolved any faster. You may ping a staff role ONCE in your ticket if it has not been answered within 24 hours.

    - Please be patient. We have a lot of tickets and we try to get to them as fast as we can. Remember, the staff are humans!
