##  🔧 How It Works
#### ⚙ So you want to know how our server works, well you are at the right place!
First of all there are 2 teams, the police team and the criminal team. The police's team goal it's to jail forever all of the criminals, the criminals' goal is to rob all of the 5 banks so they can win. then the shops come to place there are 25 shops that the criminals can rob so the can get money because they need to buy their weapons from the black market. But if there is NOT a police officer online what happens they can't rob a bank or a shop also the criminal team can't tell a police officer "Come on! Join the server I need to rob a bank!" if they say that they will be banned for 1 day and the same for an officer, they need to be atleast 2 police officers and 1 criminal so they can rob a shop. But for the bank they need to be ALL of the police team and ALL of the criminal team so they can rob a bank. Now you are wondering what if an officer arrests a criminal are they gonna be immediately to jail? The answer to that is no. They need to wait in a jail cell for 1 day, real time, so the other criminal team can help them get out if they don't they can't rob a bank if they didn't help him then he is gonna be transported to the jail and it would stay there forever doing jail jobs so he can get money if he goes to the forever jail then the other can rob a bank but they would get less money. The police team also can make money buy arresting a criminal or by playing in the server. All the players keep thier money for 2 weeks the week that they was getting and another one after that but they can still get more the other week. **BUT you are saying is the teams forever? no they are NOT forever they are for 1 week and then the change by a spin of a wheel.**

#### 👍 And that is how our server works.
